# üé¨ Movie Sentiment Analysis: Oppenheimer-like vs Avatar-like Films

## üìå Introduction
This project analyzes sentiment patterns in **critic movie reviews** to compare:
- **Oppenheimer-like films** (complex, dialogue-driven cinema represented by positive reviews)
- **Avatar-like films** (visual spectacles with mixed reception represented by negative reviews)

Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) on the NLTK `movie_reviews` corpus (containing 1,000+ real Rotten Tomatoes-style reviews), we:
1. Classify review sentiment with TextBlob
2. Compare emotional tone between film types
3. Visualize key differences in audience reception

**Key Questions Answered:**
- Do cerebral films receive more positive critic reviews than visual spectacles?
- What language patterns distinguish these film categories?
